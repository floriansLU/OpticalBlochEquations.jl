# Some Sample Jupyter Notebooks

This directory provides some sample Jupyter notebooks, which should help to install and run the program. 
They are:
* OBE-example-D1-transitions.ipynb

  Computes probe absorption for a pumped cesium vapor as a funtion of magnetic field for the four Cs D1 transitions
* OBE-example-Rabi-frequencies.ipynb

  Computes probe absorption for a pumped cesium vapor as a function of magnetic field for different pump beam Rabi frequencies.
* Angular-momentum-surface.ipynb

  Computes angular momentum probability distribution surfaces based on the steady-state ground- and excited-state density matrix for different values of the magnetic field. 
* parallel-OBE.ipynb

  An example of how to use `pmap` with the package.
